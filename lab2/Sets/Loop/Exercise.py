What is a correct syntax for looping through the items of a set?
#for x in {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}:
#print(x)

#2
myset = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
for x in myset:
  print(x)
#for and in

#3
True or False. Sets are unordered, so when you loop through the items, the order will be totally random.
#True
